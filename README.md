# luci-app-accesscontrol

This app allows you to store MAC addresses identified by a name, and easily enable or disable them in OpenWrt (LuCI).
This way it's easy to disable WiFi for your kids for example when screen time is up.

Note: Dutch (Nederlands) translation is included, but JSON doesn't seem to translate. So the menu item remains in English.
